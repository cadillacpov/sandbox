# Learn Python
## Day 1: Python Fundamentals

**Concepts:**

- Introduction to Python, its purpose, and the Python interpreter.
- Setting up the environment with an editor like VS Code and installing Python.
- Basic syntax, including indentation and the `main` function.
- Variables and fundamental data types (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`).
- Input/Output using `print()` and `input()`.
- **Arithmetic** (`+`, , , `/`, `//`, `%`) and **relational** (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`) operators.

**Practice Questions:*

1. Declare variables for your favorite book's title (string), the number of pages (integer), and the price (float). Print a summary of the book.
2. Write a program that takes two numbers from the user, multiplies them, and prints the result.
3. Write a program that asks the user for a length and width and calculates the perimeter of a rectangle.
4. Write a program that takes two integers from the user and checks if the first number is less than or equal to the second. Print the result.

## Day 2: Control Flow and Logic

**Concepts:**

- Conditional statements: `if`, `elif`, `else`.
- Loops: `for` and `while`.
- The `range()` function.
- `break` and `continue` keywords.
- **Logical** (`and`, `or`, `not`) and **bitwise** (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`) operators.

**Practice Questions:**

1. Create a program that asks the user for their age and determines if they are a minor, an adult, or a senior citizen.
2. Write a program that uses a `for` loop to print a countdown from 10 to 1.
3. Write a program that simulates a login. Ask the user for a username and a password. If both are correct, print a success message; otherwise, print an error.
4. Write a program that checks if a number is divisible by both 3 and 5.

## Day 3: Data Structures and Collections

**Concepts:**

- Introduction to built-in data structures.
- **Lists:** Ordered, mutable collections.
- **Tuples:** Ordered, immutable collections.
- **Dictionaries:** Unordered, key-value pair collections.
- **Sets:** Unordered collections of unique elements.
- **Arrays**: Large numeric datasets where memory efficiency matters.

| **Feature** | **List** | **Tuple** | **Set** | **Dictionary** | **Array** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ordered | Yes | Yes | No | Yes (3.7+) | Yes |
| Mutable | Yes | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Duplicates | Yes | Yes | No | Keys: No | Yes |
|  |  |  | Values: Yes |  |  |
| Syntax | [] | () | {} | {key:value} | array() |
| Access | Index | Index | N/A | Key | Index |
| Add Item | append() | N/A | add() | dict[key] | append() |
| Remove Item | remove() | N/A | remove() | del/pop() | remove() |
| Use Cases | General | Immutable | Unique | Key-value | Numeric |
| collections | data, | items, | mapping, | data, |  |
|  | dict keys | membership | fast lookup | efficient |  |
| Performance | Fast append | Faster than | Fast | Fast lookup | Memory |
|  | lists | membership | O(1) | efficient |  |
| Indexing | O(1) | O(1) | N/A | O(1) | O(1) |
| Search | O(n) | O(n) | O(1) | O(1) | O(n) |

**Practice Questions:**

1. Create a list of your five favorite fruits. Use a `for` loop to print each fruit on a new line.
2. Write a program that asks the user for five numbers and stores them in a list. Then, calculate and print the average of the numbers.
3. Create a dictionary of five states and their capitals. Ask the user for a state and print its capital.
4. Write a program that takes a sentence from the user and counts how many times a specific word appears.

## Day 4: Functions and Modules

**Concepts:**

- Defining and calling functions with the `def` keyword.
- Function arguments and return values.
- Scope of variables (local vs. global).
- Importing and using modules (e.g., `math`, `random`).
- Creating and importing your own modules.

**Practice Questions:**

1. Define a function `is_even()` that takes a number as an argument and returns `True` if it's even, and `False` otherwise.
2. Write a function `calculate_area(length, width)` that returns the area of a rectangle.
3. Create a module with a function that generates a random number within a user-defined range. Import and use this function in your main program.
4. Write a function `reverse_string(s)` that takes a string and returns its reversed version.

---

## Day 5: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

**Concepts:**

- Introduction to **OOP** principles: **Encapsulation**, **Inheritance**, and **Polymorphism**.
- Defining **classes** and creating **objects**.
- `__init__` method (the constructor) and the `self` keyword.
- Class and instance attributes and methods.
- Basic **inheritance**.

**Practice Questions:**

1. Define a `Dog` class with attributes for `name` and `age`. Include a method `bark()` that prints a sound.
2. Create a `Car` class with properties `make` and `model` and a method `display_info()` that prints both.
3. Create a `Shape` class with a method `area()` that returns 0. Create a subclass `Square` that overrides this method to return the area of a square.
4. Write a program that simulates a simple bank account with a `deposit` and `withdraw` method.

## Day 6: File Handling and Error Management

**Concepts:**

- Reading from and writing to files using the `open()` function.
- The `with` statement for automatic file closing.
- Handling different file modes (`'r'`, `'w'`, `'a'`).
- **Error handling** with `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks.
- Common exceptions like `ValueError` and `FileNotFoundError`.

**Practice Questions:**

1. Write a program that prompts the user for their name and then writes "Hello, [Name]!" to a file called `greeting.txt`.
2. Create a program that reads the contents of a file named `story.txt` and prints each line. Use a `try-except` block to handle a `FileNotFoundError`.
3. Write a program that asks the user for two numbers and performs division. Use a `try-except` block to handle a `ZeroDivisionError` if the second number is zero.
4. Create a simple program that reads a file and counts the total number of words in it.

## Day 7: Build a CLI Python Performance Profiler

- **Functionality:** The application must allow users to **register a script path**, execute a **performance profile** of the targeted script, and **generate a summary report** of performance bottlenecks.
- **Data Structure:** Use a **list of dictionaries** to manage the registry of scripts, where each dictionary includes keys like `'path'` (string), `'last_run_time'` (float), and `'is_optimized'` (boolean).
- **User Interface:** Implement a command-line interface controlled by a **`while` loop** that provides a menu for adding scripts, running [**cProfile**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html) benchmarks, or viewing historical results.
- **Functions:** Modularize your code into logic-specific functions such as `register_script()`, `run_profiler()`, and `export_stats()`.
- **File I/O:** Utilize **file handling** to save the profiling registry and performance logs to a local file (e.g., `performance_log.json`) to persist data between sessions.
- **Error Handling:** Wrap script execution and user input in **`try-except`** blocks to manage invalid file paths, runtime execution errors, or non-existent script dependencies.
